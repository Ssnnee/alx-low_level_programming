# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms


A search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem.
Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into
three types of algorithms: [lineara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search),
binary(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm), and hashing.


In this project we learned about searching Algorithms. We'll write some and
answer to some questions from ALX related to complexity of algorithms using.
Big O notation

**Topics** : C, Algorithms
**Style of the code**: The code is written in Betty style.

## Usage
To use the code in this project, you can to run :

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 test_main.c file_name.c -o output_name
./output_name
```

## Files
| File name         | Description |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| search_algos.h    | the header of the project      |
| 0-linear.c   | searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm     |
| 1-binary.c   | searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using Binary search algorithm     |
