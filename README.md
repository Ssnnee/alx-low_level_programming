# Alx low level programming

## Description

The repository includes several projects that illustrate low-level programming concepts using C. The projects range from basic C programming, data structures, I/O, and more. And the code is written following the [Betty](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty) style.

## Project Structure

Each project is contained in its own directory, with a descriptive name indicating the concepts covered by the programs therein. The Python programs are written to conform to the pyco Style Guide and stay true to the Zen of Python.

The directory structure is as follows:
